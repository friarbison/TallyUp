#  9/3/2022   -  TallyUp Hides in combat situations.  I had an error that caused it to 'unhide'
#                when it was not 'on' or 'active'.  So, if it was off, it would always 
#                reactivate the TallyUp display when coming out of combat.
# V2.0.0.2.plus-beta
# 10/8/2022   -  So many changes to Tallyup and supporting libraries.  Still waiting for some of the
#                library changes to hit the ground.  The API had changes in the Frame structure, particularly
#                the background templates.  TallyUp changed direction in that it relies more on the itemLink
#                instead of just the resource name.  This was driven by the changes in the tiered quality of the
#                resources in Dragonflight.  Not a bad way but it required more complixity to what was a simple
#                addon.  The display has changed; it no longer shows the bag count in the display, only what you 
#                have gathered.  Mouseover will provide the total bag count.
# V3.0.0.1   -   
# 11/24/2022 -   Updated list of resources from the most recent Bet release.
# V3.0.0.2   -   
# 11/27/2022 -   Typo that got through test.  Period instead of comma is bad in Lua!
# V3.0.0.3   -   
# 12/5/2022  -   Found a new kind of fish!
#            -   Wasn't reading the Reagent bags, missing those in the count.  Should be fixed.
# V3.0.0.4   -   
# 1/26/2023  -   Release 10.00.05 update.  Only changed the build # in the TOC.
# V3.0.0.5   -   
# 1/26/2023  -   Release 10.00.07 update.  Only changed the build # in the TOC.
