# TallyUp
WOW addon for counting resources
When you need gather a great many resources harvesting can become very monotonous and I found that I lose track of what I have collected.  So I created an addon to make it easier/quicker to see what I have actually collected.  Tallyup will keep a counter of each item you harvest/collect, add it to what is in your bag and display the results in a frame, sequentially.
Resources are Shadowlands release only, maybe a bit of Legion, but haven't needed to use it on previous releases.  It would be easy to include but I don't expect too much traffic on this little guy.  But with that said, or typed, just get in touch with Friarbison and we will see what we can do.
Enjoy the game and God bless - Friarbison - Silver Hand

A couple of the features are:
    1. automatically hide in an instance or while in combat
    2. frame can be moved, locked, unlocked.
    3. mouseover to seen totals of an item.
    4. pause to ignore gathering/collecting (good for situations like going to your bank or guild bank for withdrawals).
    5. clear if it gets too many items you aren't interested in.
    6. highlight a particular item for quick view
